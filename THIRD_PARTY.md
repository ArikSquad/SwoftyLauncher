## Geode website

The homepage in `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/Landing.vue` and `docs/.vitepress/theme/styles/landing.css` follows the look of <https://geode-sdk.org/>. It is written from scratch and contains no code or CSS from the Geode website.

## NefsEdit

`packages/formats/src/nefs.rs` reads the NeFS 1.6 archive layout that NefsEdit documents, <https://github.com/victorbush/ego.nefsedit>. It is written from scratch and contains no NefsEdit code.

## Simplified Suite

The built-in Team Simplified addon, `addons/simplified`, reads the `.serps` package format of the Simplified Suite by Team Simplified, <https://github.com/TeamSimplified/simplified-suite>. Its `mod.serps` reader (`src/serps.rs`) and its package root, content root and entry path checks (`src/package.rs`) are ported from `ModManifest.cs`, `ModImport.cs` and `ModStaging.cs` of the Simplified Launcher, with Team Simplified's permission. The Simplified Suite is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3, which section 13 lets this AGPL-3.0-or-later program combine with.
