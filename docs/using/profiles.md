# Profiles

Use a profile to keep a whole setup together: which addons are on, their load order and every addon setting. When you want to swap setups, switch profiles. Each one keeps its own saves.

To play F1 25 exactly as shipped, choose `vanilla`, the built-in profile with nothing installed. You can't edit it. Every modded profile includes the [built-in addons](/using/addons#built-in-addons), SwoftyMod and the Simplified Importer.

## Create a profile

1. Open the **Profiles** page.
2. Select the **New profile** button in the header or the dashed **New profile** card.
3. Type a name using letters, digits, `-` and `_`.
4. Select **Create**.

Your new profile starts with the built-in addons and nothing else. To fill out your setup, turn on addons on the [Addons](/using/addons) page and convert mods in the [Simplified Importer](/using/mods).

## Switch profile

You can switch in either place:

- On the **Profiles** page, select **Use this profile** on the profile's card. You'll recognise the active card by **Active** and **Used when you press Play**.
- At the bottom of the sidebar, under **ACTIVE PROFILE**, select the profile picker and choose a profile. The picker shows how many addons are on in each profile.

When you press **Play**, the launcher uses your active profile.

## Rename or duplicate

To change a profile's name or make a copy of its setup, open the **Profiles** page and expand its card footer:

- The pencil icon renames it.
- The copy icon duplicates it into a new profile with the same content.

You won't see either icon on `vanilla`, because that profile cannot be changed.

## Delete a profile

1. Open the **Profiles** page.
2. In the profile's card footer, select the trash icon.
3. Read the confirmation, then select **Delete profile**.

Deleting a profile removes its choice of addons, their settings, its build cache and its saves. Installed addons stay on the **Addons** page, and other profiles don't change. You can't undo it.

- **The active profile:** the launcher switches to another profile first and names it in the confirmation. It picks `default` if that profile exists, otherwise the first remaining profile in alphabetical order.
- **Your only profile:** you can't delete it, so the trash icon is unavailable. Create another profile first.
- **`vanilla`:** it's built in, so it has no trash icon.
- **While F1 25 runs:** close the game first. A profile that's still installed in the game folder after a crash or `swofty apply` can't be deleted until you [restore the game](/using/profiles-and-restoring).

From the command line, use `swofty profile delete <name>`. It asks before deleting; add `--yes` to skip the question. `swofty profile list` shows every profile and marks the active one.
