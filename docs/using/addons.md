# Addons

Everything the launcher loads is an addon: a folder with a `swofty.json`. A data addon changes the game's database, text, archives and files; a code addon adds an engine plugin, a launcher page or both. Mods you download for the game folder become addons through the [Mod Importer](/using/mods), and changes you make in the [DB Editor](/using/db-editor) save as addons.

## Install an addon

The two cards at the top of the **Addons** page are the ways in:

- **Installing a Swofty Addon?** Drop a `.swoftyaddon`, a zip of an addon or an addon folder on the card, or click it to choose a file. **Choose a folder…** picks an addon folder. You can also drop an addon anywhere on the launcher window.
- **Installing a mod?** **Go to Mod Importer** opens the [Mod Importer](/using/mods), which turns the mod into an addon.

A file that isn't an addon, and that no addon such as the Mod Importer imports, opens a dialog that names it. The dialog lists up to five files. **Go to Mod Importer** opens the [Mod Importer](/using/mods), and **Read the addon docs** opens the [addon reference](/reference/addons/) in your browser.

The launcher copies the addon to `$DATA/addons/<id>/`, opens **Addons** and highlights it. Installing an addon with an id that's already installed replaces it. A new addon starts off in every profile.

## Find an addon

Type in the search box on the left to search names, ids, authors and descriptions. Under it, the filters narrow the list:

| Filter | Values |
|---|---|
| Category | What the addon is for: Tracks, Liveries, Cars, Drivers & teams, Seasons, Database, Gameplay, UI, Audio, Tools, Other, or Uncategorised. Built-in addons show no category. |
| Type | What it changes: Database, Archives, Text & UI, Files, Code |
| Source | Built in, DB Editor, Mod Importer, Installed. Each row shows its source as a tag with the same name. |
| State | On, Off, Has conflicts, Update available |

Each value shows how many addons match. **Clear** removes every filter. An open panel closes when its addon no longer matches.

On a window less than 760 pixels tall, the install cards shrink to one row.

## Turn addons on or off

Each row has a switch for the active [profile](/using/profiles). The next time you press **Play**, the launcher builds the profile with the change.

Some addons, such as Driver Manager, change what your careers store. Turning one of those off asks first: careers you played with it may not load without it. Select **Turn off anyway** to go ahead, or **Cancel** to leave it on.

**Turn off all** turns off every addon except those that show **Always on** and those that would ask about your saves; the launcher names those. **Undo** on the message that follows turns the same addons back on in their old order.

In the `vanilla` profile the list is read-only. Switch to a modded profile to turn addons on.

## Load order

Addons that are on are listed first, in load order. When two addons change the same thing, the one lower in the list wins. Drag a row, or use the arrows in its panel, to move it. Rows that are always on have no drag handle.

After a conflict check, a row that is on shows **Loses to** with the number of addons lower in the list that replace some of its changes, or **Wins over** with the number it replaces. The badges go away when an addon is turned on, turned off or moved, until the next check.

## Check an addon

Select a row to open its panel: description, author, version, source, whether it works with your game version, what it changes (database values, game assets, text, files, tracks), its settings and its conflicts. **Game version** says **Works with this game version**, or names the game build the addon was made for next to yours. **Advanced** shows the addon's id.

**Conflicts** lists the addons this one overrides and the ones that override it, with what they both change. The list comes from the profile's last build. **Check conflicts**, at the top of the page and in the panel, builds the profile again without starting the game and refreshes the list. The list says it is out of date after an addon is turned on, turned off or moved, or after the addon itself changes. Play waits while a check runs.

Select a conflict to see what it covers, grouped by archive, database table, text or folder. **Details** lists the items, ten at first; **Show all** lists the rest.

An addon from the DB Editor has **Edit in DB Editor**. An addon from the Mod Importer has **Open in Mod Importer**.

## Change its settings

Change a value under **Settings** in the addon's panel. **Reset to defaults** puts every setting back. Settings save to the active profile; you can change them in game too, see [In-game addon settings](/using/swofty-mod).

## Remove an addon

Select **Remove** in the addon's panel and confirm. Removing an addon deletes its files and takes it out of every profile. Built-in addons can't be removed.

Removing a DB Editor addon deletes its changes. To keep them, select **Export** › **Share addon (.zip)** in the [DB Editor](/using/db-editor) first.

## Built-in addons

| Addon | What it does |
|---|---|
| **SwoftyMod** | Loads addons in game and adds **ADDON SETTINGS**. It's always on in modded profiles |
| **Simplified for Swofty** | Team Simplified's addon: the [Mod Importer](/using/mods). The launcher installs it, [keeps it up to date](/using/updating#simplified-for-swofty) and keeps it on |

Each release also installs a few addons switched off, such as xanpavle's F1 25 RE-Optimization; see [Addons that ship with the launcher](/using/bundled-addons).

## From a terminal

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `swofty addons list` | List installed addons and whether each is on in the profile |
| `swofty addons install <path>` | Install a folder, `.swoftyaddon` or zip |
| `swofty addons enable <id>` | Turn an addon on |
| `swofty addons disable <id>` | Turn an addon off |
| `swofty addons remove <id>` | Remove an addon and take it out of every profile |
| `swofty conflicts [--check]` | Show the profile's conflicts from its last build, or build it again first |
| `swofty settings list [id]` | List addon settings with the profile's values |
| `swofty settings set <id> <setting> <value>` | Change a setting |
| `swofty settings reset <id>` | Put an addon's settings back to their defaults |

Add `--profile <name>` to work on a profile other than the active one. For an addon that has affected your saves, `disable` and `remove` print the warning and ask before going ahead; `--yes` skips the question and is required outside a terminal.
