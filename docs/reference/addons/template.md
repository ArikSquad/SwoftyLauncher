# Templates

Pick the repository template that fits what you want to build. Copy it, change `id` in `swofty.json`, then build it. Both templates are MIT-licensed; you can use any licence for your addon.

| Template | Start here for |
|---|---|
| [`templates/launcher-addon`](https://github.com/Swofty-Developments/SwoftyLauncher/tree/main/templates/launcher-addon) | A [launcher plugin](./launcher-api): a sidebar page, an importer, a build hook and a command. |
| [`templates/addon`](https://github.com/Swofty-Developments/SwoftyLauncher/tree/main/templates/addon) | [Data](/reference/data/) and an [engine plugin](./native-plugins): database and UI edits driven by settings, plus a C++ plugin. |

## templates/launcher-addon

This template gives you a Rust helper program with just one dependency, `serde_json`. It talks to the launcher over stdin and stdout, answering `hello`, `view`, `event`, `import`, `build`, `command` and `summary`.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `swofty.json` | The manifest: `launcher` names the helper for each OS, the `Example` section, the `exmod` import extension, the build hook and the `example` command. |
| `Cargo.toml` | One binary, `example-helper`, depending on `serde_json`. |
| `src/main.rs` | The helper: an `Example` page listing imported `.exmod` files with a switch for each, an importer, a build hook and the `example` command. |
| `README.md` | Build and install steps. |

When you drop `.exmod` files, the importer copies them into your addon's `addon-data` folder. The page lists imported `.exmod` files with a per-profile switch for each, so you can choose which items to turn on. When you build, the build hook writes those items' names to `enabled.txt` and installs it with `file.put`. Run `swofty example` to print each item and whether it's on.

To build and install the helper, run:

```sh
cargo build --release
mkdir -p bin
cp target/release/example-helper bin/
swofty addons install .
swofty addons enable example.launcher-addon
```

On Windows, build `example-helper.exe` and copy it to `bin/`. Ship both binaries in `bin/`.

## templates/addon

Use this template to connect settings to both data edits and an engine plugin. Your settings drive `gamedatabases` and UI edits; the C++ engine plugin reads those settings too.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `swofty.json` | The manifest: a toggle, a choice and two sliders (one `db`, the rest `native`), and `database`, `ui` and `native` operations. |
| `db/example.json` | Database operations: a `set` whose value comes from the `penalty_seconds` setting, and a `set` through a row selector. |
| `ui/example.pkgpatch.json` | A `!pkg` patch that clones a tooltip entry in `tool_tips.uidb`. |
| `native/src/sample_plugin.cpp` | The engine plugin: reads its settings, reacts to in-game changes with `SWOFTY_ON_CHANGE` and runs one signature scan. |
| `native/include/` | The plugin C ABI (`swofty_api.h`) and the C++ layer (`swofty/*.hpp`). |
| `native/build.sh` | Builds `native/sample_plugin.dll` with `zig c++` for `x86_64-windows-gnu`. |
| `README.md` | Build and install steps. |

Build the plugin, then install and enable the addon:

```sh
native/build.sh
swofty addons install .
swofty addons enable example.sample-mod
```

If you only need data edits, remove the `native` entry from `swofty.json` and the `native/` directory. You can then install the folder as it is, without a compiler.

## Share

You can share the folder directly, or zip its contents with `swofty.json` at the root and give the archive the `.swoftyaddon` extension. Include your changes and compiled binaries, never copies of the game's archives, database or executable. See [Packaging and publishing](./publishing).
