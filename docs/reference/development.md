## Build and check

If you're on NixOS, use `nix develop` to get the development tools and libraries.

Build and check the workspace with the commands below. The launcher isn't one of the default workspace members, so you'll need the last command to build it separately.

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo build -p swofty-launcher
```

## Test with game files

Point `F1_25_DIR` at your game files to run these tests; leave it unset and they're skipped. The tests only read the files.

```sh
F1_25_DIR="/path/to/F1 25" cargo test -p swofty-formats
```

To compare with the Python tools, first set `F1_25_DIR` in your shell. Then run:

```sh
python3 tools/gamedb.py roundtrip "$F1_25_DIR/game_package/gamedatabases/gamedatabases.2025.bin"
python3 tools/erpw.py rebuild "$F1_25_DIR/2025_asset_groups/ui_package/databases.erp" /tmp/databases.erp
```

To check the ADDON SETTINGS build, run the test below. It compares the result byte for byte with a reference build of the same session (`packages/core/tests/fixtures/menu_session.json`). Make sure `F1_25_DIR` holds unmodified UI archives.

```sh
F1_25_DIR="/path/to/F1 25" SWOFTY_MENU_ORACLE=/path/to/reference cargo test -p swofty-core --test real_menus
```

To check track edits alongside ADDON SETTINGS, set `SWOFTY_MAPS_DIR` to a folder holding an imported `bahrain24` package. The same test file then checks that both are written into a single `databases.erp` and a single `persistent.erp`.

## Native loader

Build the loader, then run the Wine test:

```sh
native/build.sh
native/test/run_wine_test.sh
```

The build uses Zig to produce Windows DLLs; you'll find them in `native/dist/`. The Wine test checks the loader and ADDON SETTINGS menu entry with a small test executable.

## Documentation

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm docs:dev
pnpm docs:build
```

## Commits

Write your commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). When you commit, the hook checks Rust formatting and clippy.
