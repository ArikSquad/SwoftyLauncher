# Database operations

Database operations change game values in `game_package/gamedatabases/gamedatabases.2025.bin`. They are one kind of [operation](/reference/data/operations); for a walkthrough, see [Game database](/reference/data/database). A native plugin reads the loaded database back with [`swofty/db.hpp`](/reference/std/db), using the same keys.

## File format

List the operation file in `operations.database` in your [manifest](/reference/addons/manifest#operations), or put the same ops in an `operations.assets` file with a `db.` prefix (`db.set`):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "ops": [
    { "op": "set", "select": "tracks.Track_3", "field": "numberOfCorners", "value": "16" }
  ]
}
```

Values are strings. Write arrays as comma-separated values, such as `"0,-0.6,0"`.

## Operations

| Operation | Required fields | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `set` | `select`, `field`, `value` or `value_from` | Change a field |
| `add-row` | `table`, `from`, `set`; optional `copy`, `stat_id` | Copy a row with every key, then change its fields |
| `remove-row` | `select` | Remove a row. Not built yet: a build with it fails |
| `list-append` | `select`, `field`, `value` | Add each comma-separated value to a list field if missing |
| `list-remove` | `select`, `field`, `value` | Remove each comma-separated value from a list field |
| `put-record` | `key`, `type`, `value` | Write one raw record. `key` is a path, which can use [selectors](#selecting-rows), or `0x` and 16 hex digits, `type` the record tag and `value` hex bytes |
| `remove-record` | `key`; optional `allow_stock_removal` | Remove one record |

For `set`, use `create: true` and a `type` tag to add a missing field. `value_from` copies a value from another database path. A `set` whose `select` matches no row, or whose field doesn't exist, fails the build. A `remove-record` whose key is already absent is a no-op, logged.

`list-append` and `list-remove` treat the field as a comma-separated list and keep its order. Several addons can append to the same list without a conflict. A missing field fails the build.

### Removing stock records

A `remove-record` of a key in the game's stock database is skipped. The build warns once per addon with the count, such as `My Mod: 12 removal(s) of stock database records skipped; the game crashes when a record it reads is missing`. The addon's row on the **Addons** page shows the count after a build or a conflict check. Keys that addons add, earlier in the same addon or in another one, are removed as before. Set `"allow_stock_removal": true` on the op to remove a stock record:

```json
{ "op": "remove-record", "key": "tracks.Track_0.PoleOnRight", "allow_stock_removal": true }
```

The game crashes on any key it reads that is missing; see [Missing keys](/reference/gamedb/reading#missing-keys). A build that removes a stock record writes the database into `gamedatabases.2025.bin` instead of editing it at runtime. **Export game files (.zip)** in the DB Editor skips the same removals and lists them.

`add-row` copies every key of the source row: its fields, its sub-object keys such as `ai_vehicle_config.*` on vehicles, and its nested tables with their `_instancecount_` keys and rows, at any depth. `set` then changes keys of the copy. Every `set` key must be a key the copy has:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "ops": [
    { "op": "add-row", "table": "entrants.teams", "from": "entrants.teams.team[_metadata_=williams_26]",
      "set": { "_metadata_": "team12_26", "display_name_code": "T12" } }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `copy` | `all`: every key of the source row and every key in the file's `fields` list. `listed`: only the keys in the `fields` list | `all` |
| `stat_id` | `fresh`: the next free id above the table's highest `stat_id`. `keep`: the source row's id | `fresh` in a top-level table whose rows all have different ids, `keep` elsewhere |

### Key names

The database stores a hash of each key's path, not the path, so the build can't list a row's keys. It probes the source row with the launcher's key catalogue, `row_keys.txt.gz`: every key path found under each row shape of the stock database, generated from the identifier strings in `F1_25.exe`, `tools/gamedb/names.txt`, the key catalogue and the run-time compositions in `tools/gamedb/compositions.txt`, such as `player.driver.preloaded` on entrant setup modes. A row shape is a row path with its row numbers written `_N`: `entrants.entrant_setup_modes.entrant_setup_mode_N`.

The file's `fields` map, keyed by `table` as written or its resolved path and the row name, adds names the catalogue lacks. Every listed field must exist on the source row:

```json
"fields": { "entrants.teams.team": ["_metadata_", "stat_id", "display_name_code"] }
```

`copy: listed` keeps the behaviour of launcher 1.2.1 and earlier: the copy has only the listed fields, and the `fields` list is required.

### The completeness check

The build prints how many keys each `add-row` copied, and checks the copy against the catalogue:

| Finding | Default | `copy` |
|---|---|---|
| A key of the source row that the `fields` list doesn't name | Line: `copied 9 key(s) the fields list for … doesn't name: …` | `all` |
| A key of the source row that the `fields` list doesn't name, so the copy lacks it | Warning: `the fields list for … misses 9 key(s) of the source row, not copied: …` | `listed` |
| A row shape, of the row or a nested row, that has no catalogue entry | Warning: `the key catalogue has no entry for …` | both |

Rows past a row count that `set` lowers don't count as missing. With `"strict": true` at the top of the op file, each warning fails the build.

The build can't count the keys it can't name. An FNV-1a key gives no sign of the path it hashes, and the file holds records in hash order, so a key under the source row and a key elsewhere look alike. A key that only the game's code builds at run time, from names the exe holds in pieces, is missing from the catalogue until `tools/gamedb/compositions.txt` lists it. Regenerate the catalogue after changing that file:

```sh
cargo run --release -p swofty-core --example row_keys -- --game <F1 25 folder>
```

`cargo run -p swofty-core --example check_add_rows -- --game <F1 25 folder> --addon <addon folder>` applies an addon's database files to the stock database and prints the check. `--listed` checks the files as launcher 1.2.1 copied them; `--strict` stops at the first finding.

### Stat ids

Tables indexed by `stat_id` find a row by its id, so a copy that keeps its source's id hides the source or another copy. Every stock top-level table with a `stat_id` on each row gives each row its own id, except `f1_world.map.markers.TrackMapMarker_N`, `schedule.events.fixed_event_N` and `track_data.game_setup.TrackDataSet_N`. Among them: `entrants.entrant_lists.entrant_list_N`, `entrants.entrant_setup_modes.entrant_setup_mode_N`, `entrants.vehicles.vehicle_packages.vehicle_package_N`, `entrants.teams.team_N`, `entrants.drivers.driver_N`, `entrants.vehicles.vehicle_N` and `game_setup.game_setup_modes.game_setup_mode_N`.

A copy into such a table gets the next free id above the table's highest, and the build prints it:

```text
f1-1990: add-row entrants.entrant_lists.entrant_list_68 (from entrants.entrant_lists.entrant_list[_metadata_=f1_2026]): stat_id 105 (the source's is 67)
```

A `stat_id` in `set` wins. A copy into a nested table, such as an entrant of an entrant list, keeps its source's id; the build prints a line when the nested table's ids were all different.

An `unlockable_se_livery` row added to an `unlockable_content.unlockable_items.unlockable_item_list_<n>.folder_<m>` table, by `add-row` or by `put-record`, unlocks the new special livery. The build writes the row's ownership key, the djb2 hash of `eSELivery` and the row's `_metadata_`, to the `owned_items` block of `swofty/settings.json`, and `swofty_core.dll` reports that key as owned to the livery picker. A key that any stock database value also gives is left out with a warning.

## Selecting rows

A path names a row by its index or finds it by a field. Any segment of the path can be a selector, `Name[field=value]`:

| Path | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tracks.Track_3` | Row at index 3 |
| `entrants.teams.team[_metadata_=gm_cadillac_26]` | Team with this label |
| `track_data.game_setup.TrackDataSet[_metadata_=f1_2026].TrackData[_metadata_=melbourne]` | Melbourne's row in the `f1_2026` dataset |
| `{446668bc25ba571c}[_metadata_=f1_26]` | Row in a table whose full path is unknown |

Selectors resolve left to right, each one beneath the rows already chosen. A selector reads the table's rows up to its `_instancecount_`, or up to the first row without a `_metadata_` when the table has no count, and must match exactly one row. Otherwise the build fails and names the segment:

```text
track_data.game_setup.TrackDataSet[_metadata_=f9]: no row matches
track_data.game_setup.TrackDataSet[_metadata_=f1_2026].TrackData[_metadata_=okayama]: no row matches in track_data.game_setup.TrackDataSet_16.TrackData
```

Values are unquoted and can contain `.` and `[`. A value ends at the first `]` that ends the path or comes before a `.`.

Selectors work in `select`, `field`, `value_from`, `add-row`'s `table` and `from`, and the `key` of `put-record` and `remove-record`. A `{hash}` placeholder goes only at the start of a path; selectors can follow it.

Use labels where possible. Row numbers can change between game builds. The dataset rows under `track_data.game_setup` are listed in [A track with its own name](/reference/data/track-names#_3-the-op-file).

## The row-count rule

Adding a row also updates the table's `_instancecount_`. The game ignores rows beyond this count. A new row needs every key a stock row of the table has, which `add-row` copies; see [Key names](#key-names) and [Adding a row](/reference/gamedb/recipes#adding-a-row).

`add-row` raises the count of the table `table` resolves to. Adding to `track_data.game_setup.TrackDataSet[_metadata_=f1_2026]` raises `track_data.game_setup.TrackDataSet_16._TrackData_instancecount_`.

`add-row` needs the table's real path, written with row numbers or selectors. A `{hash}` placeholder can be used for `set`, but not for `add-row`.

A mod made for an earlier game version can lower a count and leave stock rows above it. `add-row` writes the new row over those stock keys and the build prints `reuses N stock key(s) of a row above the table's count`. A key another addon wrote at the new row's number still fails the op with `already exists`.

## Settings

A `db` [option](/reference/addons/manifest#options) changes operations at build time:

- <span v-pre>`{{id}}`</span> in any string is replaced with the option's value: `true` or `false`, the number, or the choice value.
- `"when": { "id": value }` keeps the operation only when every listed option has that value.

```json
{ "op": "set", "select": "rules.stop_go_penalty", "field": "penalty_duration", "value": "{{penalty_seconds}}" },
{ "op": "set", "select": "entrants.teams.team[_metadata_=gm_cadillac_26]", "field": "display_name_code", "value": "CAD",
  "when": { "short_names": true } }
```

Changing a `db` option marks the profile for a rebuild. The next launch, or `swofty build`, applies it.

## Applying changes

Track activation runs first, then operations run in addon load order. [DB Editor](/using/db-editor) packages are addons and run in the same order; a package change that no longer applies is skipped with a warning instead of failing the build. A later change to a field replaces the earlier value, and the build prints the conflict ([Order and conflicts](/reference/data/operations#order-and-conflicts)). With the in-game loader, the changed records reach the game through `swofty/assets.json` ([Build route and runtime route](/reference/data/operations#build-route-and-runtime-route)).

See [Game database (GVDB)](/reference/gamedb) for the file format, how the game reads it and the table catalogue. [Modding recipes](/reference/gamedb/recipes) covers adding rows, grid size and tracks.
