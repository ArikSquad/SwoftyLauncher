# Menus and UI

Every menu screen in F1 25 has a layout, its [scene](./idf), stored as an `.idf` in the game's UI archives. You change a menu by editing that scene in [Swofty UI](./swofty-ui) and shipping the result in an addon. The addon's operations put it in the game when the launcher builds a profile, so the game's own archives stay stock.

## Edit a menu

1. **Find the scene.** Open Swofty UI, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> and search for the screen ([Open the scene](./editing-menus#_1-open-the-scene)).
2. **Edit and preview it.** Move, resize, clone, rename or delete elements; Swofty UI draws the scene with the game's textures as you go ([Edit it](./editing-menus#_2-edit-it)).
3. **Export it.** Export writes the checked `.idf` and the `replace-resource` operations for every archive that holds it ([Export](./editing-menus#_3-export)).
4. **Ship it in an addon.** List the operations file under `operations.erp` in `swofty.json` ([Add it to your addon](./editing-menus#_4-add-it-to-your-addon)). Pick the route from the table below.
5. **Test it and debug it live.** Build, play, and read `swofty/loader.log`; when a count or position is fixed in native code, trace it with gdb ([Build and play](./editing-menus#_5-build-and-play), [Techniques](./techniques), [Debugging live](./debugging)).

## Ways to ship a menu change

| Change | Operation | Page |
|---|---|---|
| A moved, resized or added element | `replace-resource` in an `erp` operation file, with the exported `.idf` | [Editing menus](./editing-menus), [ERP operations](/reference/ops/erp#scenes) |
| A cloned tooltip, label or list entry in a `!pkg` resource | `patch-pkg` in an `erp` operation file (`clone-entry`, `set-value`) | [ERP operations](/reference/ops/erp#editing-pkg-resources) |
| A new screen | `operations.screens`, with a `.ui` file | [In-game UI](/reference/addons/in-game-ui#add-a-screen) |
| A new home tile | A site mixin in an engine plugin | [In-game UI](/reference/addons/in-game-ui#add-a-home-tile) |
| Settings for your addon | `options`; ADDON SETTINGS builds the page | [Settings](/reference/addons/settings) |
| Edits to screens, routes and UI databases by node | `operations.ui` patches. The build skips them for now | [UI patches](/reference/ops/ui-patches) |
