# Adding a livery

To add a special livery as an extra choice in one car's picker, you need three changes: copy the car's model into a `wep` archive, add a row to the special-livery table, and add an unlock row that the launcher reports as owned.

Here you'll build RM Designs' Scuderia AlphaTauri ORLEN livery for the 2026 Racing Bulls car. You can still select the stock Racing Bulls liveries.

```
rm-alphatauri-livery/
├── swofty.json
├── db/
│   └── se_livery.json
└── erp/
    ├── livery.json
    └── rm_object_opaque.nefx2.sm51.erp
```

Use RM Designs' archive from their download as `erp/rm_object_opaque.nefx2.sm51.erp`, without modifying it.

## 1. The manifest

```json [swofty.json]
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "id": "rmdesigns.alphatauri-orlen-livery",
  "name": "Scuderia AlphaTauri ORLEN livery",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "RM Designs",
  "kind": ["database", "erp"],
  "options": [
    {
      "id": "picker_name",
      "type": "choice",
      "label": "Name in the livery picker",
      "binds": "db",
      "default": "lng_team_tor_hashtag",
      "values": [
        { "value": "lng_team_tor_hashtag", "label": "AlphaTauri" },
        { "value": "Scuderia AlphaTauri ORLEN (RM Designs)", "label": "Literal text, no lookup" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "compat": { "game": "f1_25", "game_builds": [">=25251167"], "seasons": ["f1_2026"] },
  "operations": {
    "database": ["db/se_livery.json"],
    "erp": ["erp/livery.json"]
  }
}
```

The `picker_name` option gives you a `db` choice to fill <span v-pre>`{{picker_name}}`</span> in the livery row. Using the stock text tag `lng_team_tor_hashtag` makes the name show in every language.

## 2. The livery row and the unlock row

Give your special livery a row in `customisation.custom_se_liveries.se_liveries`. Its `wep_override` tells the car which archive to load: `_barcelona_26` on `toro_rosso_2026` loads `teams/toro_rosso/wep/toro_rosso_barcelona_26.erp`. That stock archive holds no car yet. You'll also need an unlock row to point the inventory at your new livery.

```json [db/se_livery.json]
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "ops": [
    {
      "op": "add-row",
      "table": "customisation.custom_se_liveries.se_liveries",
      "from": "customisation.custom_se_liveries.se_liveries.se_livery[_metadata_=toro_rosso_miami_2026]",
      "set": {
        "_metadata_": "toro_rosso_rm_alphatauri_2026",
        "id": "22",
        "wep_override": "_barcelona_26",
        "name_loc_tag": "{{picker_name}}",
        "desc_loc_tag": "{{picker_name}}",
        "ui_priority": "22"
      }
    },
    {
      "op": "add-row",
      "table": "unlockable_content.unlockable_items.unlockable_item_list_2.folder_23",
      "from": "unlockable_content.unlockable_items.unlockable_item_list_2.folder_23.unlockable_se_livery[_metadata_=toro_rosso_miami_26]",
      "set": {
        "_metadata_": "toro_rosso_rm_alphatauri_2026",
        "customisation_item": "toro_rosso_rm_alphatauri_2026",
        "statId": "5280"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The first op copies the stock Miami 2026 livery row, giving your livery a new label, id and archive. The second copies Miami's unlock row and points it at your livery. Choose a `statId` that no other unlock row uses.

Because `add-row` copies every field of the source row, you need to list them all in the file's `fields` map. See [Add a row](./database#_3-add-a-row).

## 3. The car

Now fill the empty `toro_rosso_barcelona_26.erp` `wep` archive. Use `copy-resource` to copy each of the car's resources from RM Designs' archive:

```json [erp/livery.json]
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "ops": [
    {
      "op": "warn",
      "message": "Scuderia AlphaTauri ORLEN by RM Designs: Racing Bulls 2026 special livery in toro_rosso_barcelona_26"
    },
    {
      "op": "copy-resource",
      "source": "erp/rm_object_opaque.nefx2.sm51.erp",
      "erp": "2025_asset_groups/f1_2026_vehicle_package/teams/toro_rosso/wep/toro_rosso_barcelona_26.erp",
      "resource": "eaid://f1_2026_vehicle_package/teams/rbswapc/idf/rbswapc.idf?lod=all&ib=0"
    }
  ]
}
```

You'll need one `copy-resource` per resource in the full file: the model's index and vertex buffers, its materials and textures, the two `cf_pattern_6` textures, and RM Designs' world and layers. To find what to copy, list the archive's resources with `tools/erp.py` ([Look inside an archive](./erp-assets#look-inside-an-archive)).

## 4. Ownership

Your livery only appears in the picker when the player's inventory marks its unlock as owned. The ownership key comes from the djb2 hash of `eSELivery` followed by the unlock row's `_metadata_` label. For `toro_rosso_rm_alphatauri_2026`, that gives you `0xf01d03c7`.

The launcher handles ownership when you build the profile. It compares the built database with the stock one and writes every `unlockable_se_livery` row a mod adds to a folder under `unlockable_content.unlockable_items.unlockable_item_list_<n>` to `owned_items` in `swofty/settings.json`:

```json
"owned_items": [
  { "key": "0xf01d03c7", "addon": "rmdesigns.alphatauri-orlen-livery", "what": "se_livery 22" }
]
```

SwoftyMod reports these keys as owned in game. If a stock row already gives the same key, it's left out and you get a warning. If two rows give the same key, it's reported once.

## 5. Build and check

Install your addon, enable it, then build:

```sh
swofty addons install ./rm-alphatauri-livery
swofty addons enable rmdesigns.alphatauri-orlen-livery
swofty build
```

Check the build output for the `warn` message and one line per owned item:

```text
items: rmdesigns.alphatauri-orlen-livery unlock row toro_rosso_rm_alphatauri_2026 (se_livery 22) is reported as owned, key 0xf01d03c7
```

In game, you'll find the livery in the Racing Bulls car's picker. If it's missing while the stock Miami and Suzuka 2026 liveries show, the rows loaded but the ownership check hid your livery. Check `owned_items` in the session's `swofty/settings.json`.

To share your livery, follow [Packaging a mod](./packaging).
