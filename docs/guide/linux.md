# Linux and Steam Deck

You run F1 25 through Steam and Proton. With mods, you'll be playing single-player and offline.

## Set up

1. Follow [Installation](/guide/installation) to install the launcher with the installer or by hand.
2. Start Steam. You need F1 25 installed and a Proton version selected for it.
3. Open F1 25 in Steam → the gear icon → **Properties** → **General**.
4. To have Steam launch the modded game, enter this line in **Launch options**. Replace `<install folder>` with the full path of the install folder, such as `/home/deck/SwoftyLauncher`:

   ```text
   <install folder>/bin/swofty run -- %command%
   ```

You can now start the modded game with either Steam's **Play** button or the launcher's **Play** button. To launch vanilla through Steam again, clear the launch option.

If you use **Flatpak Steam**, the install folder must be inside `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/`. Use that folder's `bin/swofty` in the launch option.

## Play

1. Open **Swofty Launcher** from the app menu, or `bin/swofty-launcher` in the install folder.
2. [Install your addons](/using/addons) and [mods](/using/mods), then pick a [profile](/using/profiles).
3. Press **Play**.
4. On your first launch, you'll see the **Modded play runs offline** dialog. Select **Accept and launch**. For details, see [Offline play](/reference/safety).

To see live logs as you play, keep Steam running and run `swofty run` from a terminal.

## Steam Deck

Install the launcher and set the launch option in Desktop Mode. Once that's set, you can use **Play** in the Deck's library to start the modded game in Game Mode too.

## If the game crashes

The session puts the game folder back to vanilla when the game exits, crash or not. If the launcher was closed first, it puts the folder back the next time it starts. See [Restoring the game](/using/profiles-and-restoring).

To read a summary of your last session, run `swofty logs`.

## Advanced launch settings

If your setup needs CPU affinity or environment variables, set them in `$DATA/config.json`:

```json
{
  "launch": {
    "cpu_affinity": "0-11,14-31",
    "env": { "VKD3D_SHADER_CACHE_PATH": "0" }
  }
}
```

You can use NixOS too. To run the latest code instead of a release, [build from source](/reference/development).
