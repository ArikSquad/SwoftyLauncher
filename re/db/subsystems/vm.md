# vm: UI view-model registry

Owner: see `subsystems.tsv`. Write-up: research/exe.md §1 (conventions), §3.4; research/ui-native.md (binding, dispatch, screens, routes).

## Map
- `g_Vm_Registry` (0x146ca54f8) is the registry singleton pointer; T000 saw it non-null after the main window appeared.
- `Vm_Set_String(reg, parent, name, NeStr**, overwrite)` → `Vm_NodeSet_String(node, v, 0, 1)`; `Vm_Set_Bool(...)` → `Vm_NodeSet_Bool`. `Vm_Set_Int` (0x140d38fd0) and `Vm_Set_UInt` (0x140d38210) are the int/index siblings. overwrite=1 replaces an existing value.
- `parent` for an item's properties is `HomeItem.button_node.node + 8`; with no node use `k_Vm_EmptyNodeHandle` (0x146ca0e90).
- Node names and commands are djb2 hashes (`h_*` anchors); components use md5-64 (ui.md).

## UI node-class (widget) registry {#classes}
Every `.ui` node has a 4-char class FourCC. `Vm_Register_NodeClasses` (0x14419b1d0, L2) constructs ~97 class-factory objects (each 0xc0 bytes: vtable at +0x00, FourCC tag at +0x10) and installs them through the callback `Vm_Install_NodeFactories` (0x1441cac40, L2), which does `Vm_Find_NodeFactory(mgr, fourcc)` (0x14416bc70) per class and registers the factory at `mgr+0x8210`'s vtable+0x38. `Vm_Build_UidfNode`/`Vm_Read_UidfNode` look a node's class up here when a screen loads; a FourCC with no factory makes the node build fail with code 5 (ui-native.md §10).

The 97 classes, in registration order (FourCC → best-known role; `UIxx` = NeUI element, `DBxx` = data-binding node, others engine):
```
UIGL group-list   UIGA  UIGR  UIGV  UIFL flow   UISE screen-entry/route-group   UISC screen
UISA  UIEX  UIAC action/route-pin   UINT  UICM  UICT  UIGP group   UIKL  UIDD  UILB label
UILS  UISU  UIBT button   UIHB  UIHC  UITG toggle   UIVP  F1FV fullscreen-video   UISR  UILT list
UIL2 list2   UITB toggle-bar   UIEL element-list   UILA  UILE  UISL slider   UITE text-entry
UITV  PNSQ  UIVC  UITI  UICO  UIRU  UITL  UITT  UISN  UIXA  UISB  SCRL scroll   UICF  UIPL

```
Unannotated tags are known classes whose role is not yet read (L1, `imm:` the FourCC). The two-letter suffix is a stable hint (…L=list, …B=button/bar, …P=panel, …N=input/node).

## Element class inits (per-class `vt[0x48]` from-data init) {#element-init}
Shared base chain (ui-native.md §11): `Vm_ElementBase_Init` (0x1441ffb90, ~64 classes; returns 3 without componentId/nodeId) → `Vm_ListBase_Init` (0x144208c80; shared by UITG/UITB/UILT/UIL2/UIEL; its result is `Vm_Read_PropBinding(props,"data")`). Concrete inits:
- `Vm_UiToggle_Init` (0x144272810, UITG), `Vm_UiSlider_Init` (0x1442593b0, UISL; reads flags with `Vm_Read_PropBool` at +0xa4..+0xa7/+0x18, then PropBinding data/value/min/max/step — all int, no float).
- Property readers: `Vm_Read_PropBinding` (0x14417e200; dbentry: no key→3, missing/empty→5), `Vm_Read_PropBool` (0x144206120).

## Node helpers {#nodes}
- `Vm_Resolve_RegistryNode` (0x1442b1b60, L1, **2166 refs**): resolve a `g_Vm_Registry` node by a path-string token (`#ui_menu_data.…`, `view_model_data.…`, `network.…`). The core VM lookup — frontend and HUD VMs both go through it. `Vm_Link_RegistryNode` (0x144179360, 918 refs) links the resolved node into a holder/handle.
- `Vm_GetOrCreate_ChildNode` (0x1442b2bf0, L2): resolve/create a child node under a parent; `k_Vm_EmptyNodeHandle` on miss.
- `Vm_Resolve_NodePath_Thunk` (0x1442b2770) is the path-resolve used by `Vm_Apply_BindingEvent` and the core `set_*` API.

## Routing {#routes}
- `Vm_Fire_Route(router, vm, &name, flag)` (0x1442c0e20, L2, 266 callers): looks the VM's node up in the router robin-hood map (router+0x48), finds the `UISE` route-group element and calls the route runner.
- **`Vm_Run_Route` (0x144188370, L2)** is that runner (previously unmapped, ui-native.md §9): `void(uiSys, node, routeName, group, int, a6, a7)`, invoked as `Vm_Run_Route((*uiSys)->vt[0x1c0](), node, name, group, 0, flag, 0)`. It runs the route steps and is where a missing-screen step raises its error — the single hook point for the route guard, covering both native `Vm_Fire_Route` routes and data-fired UIAC pins.
- Route-command executors (slot +0x58 of each route-cmd vtable): `Vm_RouteCmd_ResolveTargetScreen` (0x144187620), `Vm_RouteCmd_OpenScreen` (0x143889310) → `Vm_Open_Screen` (0x144182660).
- `Vm_Update_FlowStateMachine` (0x144423ce0, sig `vm.flow_update`) ticks the flow state machine each frame; it logs `State [%s] onUpdate returned LinkRoute [name,hash]` (0x144424e27) and drives screen navigation. The frontend-side states live in the `fe_flow` lane.

## Open
- `Vm_Fire_Route`/label rendering not yet runtime-confirmed (trace test).
- Hook point for brand-new data commands (`raise_command {name}`): generic dispatch is `Vm_Dispatch_BindingMessage` (0x1442c00e0); per-screen handlers are `*VM::onCommandRaised` slot 10.
- Element class vtables beyond toggle/slider not yet named individually; the factory objects built by `Vm_Register_NodeClasses` are the enumeration point (one 0xc0 object per FourCC, in the order above).

## Inbox
- 2026-10-17 17:11 ui-native: 2026-10-17 ui-native: VM binding registry, Vm_Dispatch_BindingMessage (0x1442c00e0, commands 0x4c / events 0x4d), VM vtable slot map, and the missing-screen route failure are written up in research/ui-native.md sections 1, 2 and 9. All new rows are L2 at most and unverified. T006 traces the dispatcher.
- 2026-10-17 17:46 ui-native: 2026-10-17 ui-native: screen fill path Vm_Load_UidfResource -> Vm_Load_UidfScreens (job on mgr+0xb900); prototype native/src/core/ui.cpp registers mod screens through it and guards missing route targets (research/ui-native.md section 10).
- 2026-10-18 22:13 telemetry: telemetry lane: per-frame publish hook point is Vm_Update_FlowStateMachine 0x144423ce0. Verified unique .xtls signature (matches exactly once, resolves to base+0x4423ce0): 41 57 41 56 41 55 41 54 56 57 55 53 48 81 EC 58 02 00 00 C5 F8 29 B4 24 40 02 00 00 C5 F9 28 F2 48 89 . native/src/core/telemetry.cpp installs a safetyhook mid hook here (gated by the experimental telemetry feature) to advance the feed frame counter and session clock each frame.
- 2026-10-19 13:22 ea-port: EA port: ui_vm.cpp view-model Targets (Vm_Register_ViewModel, Ne_Set_FixedString, Vm_Resolve_NodePath_Thunk, Vm_Set_Int call, Vm_Register_BindingNode) and vtable rvas are Steam-specific and scan .xtls; on EA they must scan .rdata and need patterns from a decrypted-memory dump. g_Vm_Registry/Vm_Set_String/Vm_Set_Bool (bindings.json) same situation.
- 2026-10-23 14:59 era-picker: era-picker: added Vm_GetOrCreate_ListChild (0x1442b30e0, sig vm.get_or_create_list_child, func_start) and Vm_Set_NodeRef (0x14083c270, sig vm.set_node_ref, bound through its call 0x141a6eeb9 in FeTile_Build_EraTiles because the setter template clones share its prologue) at L2 for the era picker's addon row. The lane is owned by ui-re, so the rows were added with the lead override; the owner may want to fold them into the vm map. The vt+0x10 / vt+0x28 child tests read as list node / object node: Vm_GetOrCreate_ListChild keeps a child only when vt+0x10 is true and creates with 0x1442b2f70, Vm_GetOrCreate_ChildNode keeps vt+0x28 children and creates with 0x1442b2a50, and Vm_Set_NodeRef links a new child by list append (0x1442b32b0) or keyed insert (0x1442b3770) on the same split.
