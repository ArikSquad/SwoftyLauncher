# Bridge: mailbox, snapshot, status, journal

Owner: bridge (`native/src/bridge.cpp`, `state.cpp`, `plugin.cpp`, `launcher/`).

All files live in the addon's storage folder, `<game>/swofty/addons/swofty.career-editor/` (the `addon_game_dir` host call). The game side writes them with the storage library (atomic temp + rename). The launcher writes inbox files atomically as well: `inbox/<seq>.json.tmp`, then rename to `inbox/<seq>.json`. Names that don't match `<digits>.json` are ignored.

| file | writer | reader |
|---|---|---|
| `inbox/<seq>.json` | launcher | game (deleted once acked) |
| `outbox/<seq>.json` | game | launcher (deletes it after reading) |
| `snapshot.json` | game | launcher |
| `journal.jsonl` | game (append) | launcher |

## Batches (`inbox/<seq>.json`) {#batches}

```json
{
  "seq": 1792467946485,          // unique, increasing; the launcher uses max(last + 1, unix ms)
  "session": "launcher-run-id",  // echoed in the ack and the journal
  "label": "Set cash",           // free text, echoed in the journal
  "stop_on_error": false,        // true: skip the remaining ops after the first failure
  "ops": [
    { "op": "economy.cash.set", "args": { "value": 5000000 }, "expect": 4200000 }
  ]
}
```

- At most 256 ops per batch. Batches run in `seq` order, one per frame.
- `expect` is copied into `args.expect` when `args` has none. Ops that support stale checks compare it with the live value before writing and fail with an error when they differ.
- Gate: a batch with any `CE_OP` op waits for `safe` (Team HQ idle). A batch whose ops are all `CE_OP_ANYTIME` waits only for `career` (any career state except loading). A waiting batch stays in the inbox; `snapshot.bridge.blocked` says which one and why. Each op re-checks its own gate when it runs.
- The launcher withdraws a waiting batch by deleting its inbox file.
- An inbox file whose ack already exists in `outbox/` is dropped without running (no double apply after a restart).
- `bridge.ping` (no args) runs at any time, touches nothing and answers `{boot, mode, safe}` in `before`/`after`. Use it to prove the mailbox end to end.

## Acks (`outbox/<seq>.json`) {#acks}

```json
{
  "seq": 1792467946485, "boot": 1792467944023, "session": "launcher-run-id",
  "t": 1792467948106,             // unix ms when the batch ran
  "mode": "my_team",
  "ok": false,                    // every op ok
  "ms": 1,
  "results": [
    { "i": 0, "op": "economy.cash.set", "ok": true, "ran": true, "error": null,
      "args": { "value": 5000000, "expect": 4200000 },
      "before": { "cash": 4200000, "team": 655370 }, "after": { "cash": 5000000, "team": 655370 } },
    { "i": 1, "op": "nope.op", "ok": false, "ran": false, "error": "unknown op 'nope.op' (not in this build)",
      "args": {}, "before": null, "after": null }
  ]
}
```

`args` are the args the op received (with `expect` merged in). `ran` is true when the op's code ran (a failed op may still have read state). A rejected batch (unreadable, not JSON, no `ops`, too many ops) gets `{"seq", "boot", "t", "ok": false, "error": "...", "results": []}`.

Every op and section call runs inside an SEH guard (access violation, in-page error, divide by zero, illegal instruction, misalignment). A fault answers the op with `fault 0x<code> inside the op`, logs `FAULTED`, and switches that op or section off until the game restarts (`off` in the snapshot lists). C++ exceptions are caught too.

Error strings the bridge itself produces: `unknown op '<name>' (not in this build)`, `blocked: <why>`, `skipped: an earlier op in the batch failed`, `op switched off after a fault this session: ...`, `fault 0x<code> inside the op`, `exception: ...`.

## Journal (`journal.jsonl`) {#journal}

One line per op that succeeded (failed ops are only in the ack):

```json
{"t":1792467946485,"seq":100,"i":0,"session":"s1","label":"Set cash","mode":"my_team","op":"economy.cash.set","args":{"value":5000,"expect":1000},"before":{"cash":1000},"after":{"cash":5000}}
```

Undo is built by the launcher from journal lines (see each area's op docs for what undo means per op; the default is the same op with `args.value` set from `before`).

## Snapshot (`snapshot.json`) {#snapshot}

Rewritten when its content changes (checked every second, and right after a batch runs or a batch starts waiting) and at least every 5 s as a heartbeat. Nothing in it ticks on its own: `flow[].since` is the unix ms the state entered its status and `sections_at` is when a section last changed, so an idle game writes only the heartbeat. `written` older than about 20 s means the bridge is not running.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "written": 1792467954741,       // unix ms
  "boot": 1792467944023,          // changes when the game restarts
  "pid": 12345,
  "addon": { "id": "swofty.career-editor", "version": "0.1.0", "api": 5 },
  "status": { ... },              // below
  "bridge": {
    "pending": [1792467946485],   // queued seqs
    "blocked": { "seq": 1792467946485, "why": "Team HQ is advancing time" } | null,
    "last_ack": 1792467946400 | null,
    "applied": 12, "failed": 1,   // op counts this game session
    "ops": [ { "name": "economy.cash.set", "anytime": false, "off": null | "fault 0x... " } ],
    "sections": [ { "name": "economy", "off": null } ],
    "duplicates": []              // registrations ignored because the name was taken
  },
  "sections_live": true,          // false: the sections below are the last values seen (or absent)
  "sections_at": 1792467954741 | null,   // when a section last changed
  "sections": { "economy": { ... }, "season": { ... }, ... }
}
```

A section is absent when it has never rendered in this career. Sections render only while a career is loaded and the flow is settled (Team HQ idle, the weekend hub, or a running session), the launcher page is open (`viewer.json`, which the page rewrites every 3 s, is under 15 s old) and the game is not the window in front; they are cleared when the career unloads. A section that faults is switched off for the game session and listed with `off`.

### Status {#status}

```json
{
  "game": "running",
  "career": true,                 // a career is loaded
  "mode": "my_team" | "driver_career" | "none",
  "career_id": "mt-000a000a-00004000" | null,   // ce::career_id(), see below
  "humans": 1,                    // human entrants; more than 1 blocks every op (two-player career)
  "phase": "team_hq" | "team_hq_busy" | "weekend_hub" | "session" | "loading" | "frontend" | "unknown",
  "safe": true,                   // CE_OP ops can run now
  "anytime": true,                // CE_OP_ANYTIME ops can run now
  "why": null | "a session is running; edits wait for Team HQ",
  "why_anytime": null | "no career is loaded",
  "season": 1 | null, "year": 2026 | null, "round": 5 | null, "rounds": 24 | null,
  "day": null, "weekend": "rw_miami" | null,           // copied from the season section
  "player": { "driver": 655361, "team": 655370 } | null, // packed keys (components helper)
  "detect": {
    "components": "live" | "no entity seen yet" | "fallback to flow",
    "component_mode": "my_team" | "driver_career" | "none",
    "team_hq_answer": "my_team" | "driver_career" | "none",
    "flow_career": true
  },
  "state": "StateTeamHQUpdate",   // the last flow state that changed status (or "#<djb2>")
  "transitions": 812,
  "flow": [ { "state": "StateTeamHQUpdate", "status": "Updating", "since": 1792467950000 } ]
}
```

`career_id` (`ce::career_id()`, empty in C++ when unknown): `mt-<team key>-<driver key>` in My Team, `dc-<driver key>` in Driver Career (8 hex digits each, the player's packed keys from the components helper). It is stable for a career's life (the My Team team and the Driver Career driver never change) but two careers with the same team and driver share it. The save slot would be a better key; the slot manager component is not bound yet.

`why` values: `no career is loaded`, `two-player careers are not supported`, `Team HQ is advancing time`, `Team HQ is heading to a session`, `Team HQ is running the end of season`, `Team HQ is in the season break`, `a session is running; edits wait for Team HQ`, `not in Team HQ`, `Team HQ is settling` (the first 0.75 s after Team HQ comes up). `why_anytime`: `no career is loaded`, `the game is loading`.

## State detection {#state-detection}

| binding | what the bridge reads |
|---|---|
| `site_FeFlow_SetStateStatus` (in `FeFlow_Set_StateStatus` 0x144423180, the function behind the FLOW log line `Transitioning "<state>" <old> -> <new>`) | rcx = flow state, edx = new status (0 None, 1 Entering, 2 Updating, 3 Exiting); state `+0xb0` = djb2 of the state name, `+0xb8` = old status; `+0x20`/`+0x28` = name, copied only when it is plain text (djb2 matches) |
| `site_Career_TeamHqIsMyTeamResult` (in `Career_StateTeamHq_OnStateEnter`, after `Career_Is_MyTeamGameMode_Thunk`) | al = the game's own My Team answer, which picks `enter_my_team_career` vs `enter_team_hq` |
| `ce::comp` (components helper, economy) | entity + `CareerComponent` = career loaded; `CareerBank` or `MyTeamFacilities` = My Team, `DriverCareerPlayerDriverStatistics` = Driver Career; the human entrant's keys |

Tracked states: `StateTeamHQ`, `StateTeamHQUpdate`, `StateTeamHQTimeAdvance`, `StateTeamHQToSession`, `StateTeamHQEndOfSeason`, `StateTeamHQSeasonBreak`, `StateSession`, `StateLoadSession`, `StateUnloadSession`, `SessionStateCareerHubUpdate`, `PostRaceCareerHub`, `StateCareerHubSelector`, `StateFrontend`, `StateOnlineFrontend`, `StateFrontendWorld`, `StateCareerDataSync`. Both sites only read. The log gets one `[career-editor] flow:` line per tracked transition and one per first sighting of any other state.

## Launcher side {#launcher}

The launcher plugin (`launcher/`, `career-editor-helper`) keeps its own files in `$DATA/addon-data/swofty.career-editor/`:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `sent.jsonl` | every batch it wrote: seq, label, career id, ops, and `undo_of` for undo batches |
| `history.jsonl` | every acked op (from `outbox/`, which it then deletes): before, after, error, args, career id |
| `backups/<YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS>/remote/` + `backup.json` | Steam save folder copies (`steam_save_dir`) |
| `backups/session.json` | the game session (launcher session, else pid + snapshot `boot`) already backed up |
| `prefs.json` | page choices (ratings edit mode, R&D team) |

- Before the first batch of each game session it copies the Steam save folder; a failed copy stops the batch. Without a Steam save folder it sends and says no backup was taken.
- Restore needs the game closed and an explicit switch; it first backs up the current saves, then copies the backup's files over the save folder (files not in the backup are left alone).
- Undo sends the inverse op with `expect` = the edit's `after`: `economy.cash.*` → `economy.cash.set` to `before.cash`; `economy.rp.*` → `economy.rp.set` to `before.rp`; `drivers.ratings.set` → the same op with the `before` values and `"mode": "restore"`; `rnd.fit` → the opposite `fitted`; `season.calendar.reorder` → the `before` order of the future rounds; `weather.plan.*` → `weather.plan.set` with the `before` sessions; `weather.seed.*` → lock with `before.seed` or unlock. `rnd.complete/unlock/reset/refund` and `facilities.*` are backup-only. History and undo are scoped to the loaded `career_id`.
- One sidebar section, `editor` ("Career Editor"): a status hero, then a `tabs` bar (Overview, Team, Drivers, R&D, Season, Weather, History). The active tab lives in the helper for the launcher session. A tab whose section the bridge doesn't register is disabled; History shows the queued count as a badge.
- A snapshot that doesn't parse (or isn't UTF-8) keeps the last good one on screen with an "Editor data unreadable" notice; the bridge's Writer replaces invalid UTF-8 with U+FFFD and escapes control characters, and logs any section over 64 KB once.
- Failed ops show their error code as the result pill and the detail beside it; a result with `after.not_applied` shows as "Stored, not applied" with the reason.
- Pages poll through `tick` (snapshot and outbox mtimes, `game_status`) and `invalidate` every section when something changed. Forms are disabled until the bridge is live with a career loaded; an op missing from `snapshot.bridge.ops` shows as not available in this build.
