"""Which suit each team-season and each driver of 2016 to 2021 wears.

A real suit is a mod's suit (data/real_suits.json "suits", built by build_real_suits.py into this addon's suits/) or a
stock F1 25 suit of a season in "stock_seasons" (the team's <year>-<stock team> suit and its drivers'
<year>-<stock team>_<driver> suits). A team-season takes the real team suit of its own season, else the one of the
nearest season with the same team name in data/seasons.json, the earlier season on a tie, else its generated suit
(build_suits.py). Only team suits decide the season. Every driver of the team-season wears that season's kit: his own
suit of that season and team when there is one, else that season's team suit. "suit": {"source": "<label>" |
"generated"} on a team overrides the team's choice.

Labels: a mod's team suit is cs<yy>-<stock team> of its own season, a mod's driver suit cs<yy>-<base folder>, both the
length of the base label they replace. A generated suit is cg<yy>-<stock team>, or cg<yy>-<key> padded with "_" to the
base label's length for a team with its own key (2016 Manor: cg16-manor_).
