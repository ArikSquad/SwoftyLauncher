# SwoftyMod

SwoftyMod (`swofty.core`) is the built-in addon. It adds core functionality for addon loading and customisation in Swofty Launcher for F1 25. It is always enabled and cannot be disabled or removed.

It provides:

* **ADDON SETTINGS** directly under Career on the home screen, added by a `MidHook` in `swofty_core.dll` (`native/src/core/`)
* the **F9 / R3 prompt** "Addon Settings", a listener and a tooltip entry
* the bottom-left "Launched with Swofty Launcher" panel, with the F9 or R3 glyph and "to open settings"
* the `mod_menu` route
* the ADDON SETTINGS screen, with a tile per enabled addon and map and a page for each
* its own setting, `show_launcher_panel`

This directory holds the manifest only, never game files. The launcher builds the UI at build time from the player's own copy of the game data (`packages/core/src/ui/`):

| Archive in `2025_asset_groups/ui_package/` | Edits |
|---|---|
| `flow_frontend.erp` | `fe_home.ui`: the F9 / R3 listener, the `mod_menu` tooltip, the launcher panel text and signals |
| `persistent.erp` | the `mod_menu` route, a route group per screen, `options_flow` entries and loading regions for the screens |
| `databases.erp` | the `mod_menu`, `mod_menu_offline` and `swofty_adjust` tooltips, and the `ui_menu_data.swofty` state |
| `flow_persistent.erp` | the online services popup, shown once as the SwoftyMod changelog |

The screens go to `swofty/ui/` (`swofty_settings.ui`, one `swofty_addon_<n>.ui` per enabled addon, one `swofty_map_<n>.ui` per map) and are listed in the `ui` block of `swofty/settings.json`. `swofty_core.dll` registers them and drives the option rows of `swofty_addon_<n>` pages.

The DLLs are produced by `native/build.sh` and are not committed; the launcher installs the whole `native/dist/` set (`version.dll`, `swofty_core.dll`, `swofty_gamelog.dll`, `bindings.json`, `symbols.tsv`, `log_channels.tsv`) for each modded session. See [`native/README.md`](../../native/README.md).

`packages/core/tests/real_menus.rs` compares the output byte for byte with a reference build named by `SWOFTY_MENU_ORACLE`.
