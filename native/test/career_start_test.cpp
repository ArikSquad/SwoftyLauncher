// Host unit test for the career start gate's pure parts (career_start.hpp): the route table maps
// the front-end career routes to a mode and a kind and leaves every other route alone, blocks are
// held per owner and mode, and the popup throttle lets one popup through per gap.
// run_events_test.sh builds and runs it.
